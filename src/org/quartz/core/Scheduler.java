/**
 * This is the main interface of a Quartz Scheduler.
 * <p>
 * A <code>Scheduler</code> maintains a registry of <code>{@link org.quartz.jobs.JobDetail}</code>s and <code>{@link Trigger}</code>s. Once
 * registered, the <code>Scheduler</code> is responsible for executing <code>Job</code> s when their associated <code>Trigger</code> s fire (when
 * their scheduled time arrives).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>Scheduler</code> instances are produced by a <code>{@link SchedulerFactory}</code>. A scheduler that has already been created/initialized can
 * be found and used through the same factory that produced it. After a <code>Scheduler</code> has been created, it is in "stand-by" mode, and must
 * have its <code>start()</code> method called before it will fire any <code>Job</code>s.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>Job</code> s are to be created by the 'client program', by defining a class that implements the <code>{@link org.quartz.jobs.Job}</code>
 * interface. <code>{@link JobDetail}</code> objects are then created (also by the client) to define a individual instances of the <code>Job</code>.
 * <code>JobDetail</code> instances can then be registered with the <code>Scheduler</code> via the <code>scheduleJob(JobDetail, Trigger)</code> or
 * <code>addJob(JobDetail, boolean)</code> method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>Trigger</code> s can then be defined to fire individual <code>Job</code> instances based on given schedules. <code>SimpleTrigger</code> s are
 * most useful for one-time firings, or firing at an exact moment in time, with N repeats with a given delay between them. <code>CronTrigger</code> s
 * allow scheduling based on time of day, day of week, day of month, and month of year.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>Job</code> s and <code>Trigger</code> s have a name and group associated with them, which should uniquely identify them within a single
 * <code>{@link Scheduler}</code>. The 'group' feature may be useful for creating logical groupings or categorizations of <code>Jobs</code> s and
 * <code>Triggers</code>s. If you don't have need for assigning a group to a given <code>Jobs</code> of <code>Triggers</code>, then you can use the
 * <code>DEFAULT_GROUP</code> constant defined on this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Stored <code>Job</code> s can also be 'manually' triggered through the use of the <code>triggerJob(String jobName, String jobGroup)</code>
 * function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Client programs may also be interested in the 'listener' interfaces that are available from Quartz. The <code>{@link JobListener}</code> interface
 * provides notifications of <code>Job</code> executions. The <code>{@link TriggerListener}</code> interface provides notifications of
 * <code>Trigger</code> firings. The <code>{@link SchedulerListener}</code> interface provides notifications of <code>Scheduler</code> events and
 * errors. Listeners can be associated with local schedulers through the {@link ListenerManager} interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The setup/configuration of a <code>Scheduler</code> instance is very customizable. Please consult the documentation distributed with Quartz.
 * </p>
